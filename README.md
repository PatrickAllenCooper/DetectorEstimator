# DetectorEstimator
Finds basic metrics on available feature detectors in opencv 2.4.

Written in python, intended for use with opencv 2.4 and python 2.
Is not compatible with newer iterations on either platform. Opencv3 has discarded a few very useful feature detectors including
SIFT and SURF.

Future objectives include cleaning the logic, removing redundant code, and integrating additional detectors until it is a sort of general
approach for handling feature detectors and finding which one is best suited for particular jobs.
